# Scoring

## What's New for 2025

### Transfers

If your driver competes in the Sprint but is replaced before Grand Prix Qualifying, you'll get a transfer suggestion so you can avoid Not Classified penalties. This suggestion still comes out of your transfer limit, and is still a -10 point penalty if you exceed it.

### Pitstops

Every team will now get points for pitstops during the Grand Prix (but not Sprints). The number of points each team gets will be based on their fastest pitstop during the race. A 5-point bonus will go to the constructor who records the fastest pitstop of the race. Set a new world record, and they'll score a 15-point bonus.

### Disqualification penalties

Penalty points for being disqualified will now be applied to their constructor instead of the driver themselves. Disqualified drivers will not gain any points for the session they were disqualified from.

### Scoring

Points will be awarded/deducted based on the Driver/Constructor's performance at the Grand Prix. Classifications through the weekend are based on decisions made by the FIA and Formula 1®

## Notes

* Positions gained/lost are calculated based on the starting and finishing position of the driver in the race and not they're qualifying result. Unclassified drivers will not have any positions lost calculated, instead they will receive the -20point penalty. Cars starting from the pitlane will be considered to have started from a position relative to the last car on the grid.

** Overtakes are considered valid when one driver legally passes another on track, and the driver passed was not entering or in the pit lane or suffering a car failure or going unreasonably slow.

*** Driver Of The Day is the result of the official F1® Driver Of The Day award.

**** Additional penalty points earned for disqualifications will now be applied to the constructor instead of the drivers. Disqualified drivers will only receive the Not Classified penalties (-20 for the race instead of the previous -25 points). The constructor will receive an additional 10 point penalty for disqualification from the race/sprint, resulting in -30 points as the driver's contribution to their race/sprint total. The same follows for the qualifying session, with an additional 5 point penalty to the constructor for the disqualification, resulting in -10 points as the driver's contribution to the qualifying total.
